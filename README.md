# Turbin3 WBA cohort Q3 2024

This repository contains all the work done during the Turbin3 WBA cohort Q3 2024. Projects will be added while cohort continues.

## Cap Stone project

This is the project that will be designed from scratch by the participant to complete the cohort.
Starting with an idea, moving this forward to user stories, then an architectural diagram and finally the implementation.

I will focus on a peer to peer price betting platform.

User stories:
- [User stories](./price-betting/docs/user-stories.md)
- [Architectural diagram](./price-betting/docs/arch-diagram_price-bets.png)
- [Implementation](./price-betting/README.md)
